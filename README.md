# Vanguard A/B Test Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the results of Vanguard’s digital A/B test, designed to evaluate whether a redesigned user interface with in-context prompts improves client completion rates compared to the traditional interface.  

The analysis includes:  
- Data cleaning and integration  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Key performance metrics definition  
- Hypothesis testing and experiment evaluation  
- Tableau visualizations  

Final deliverables include cleaned datasets, reproducible notebooks, functions in `.py` files, Tableau dashboards, and a project presentation.

## 🎯 Business Proposal  
Vanguard’s CX team wants to determine whether the new digital interface enhances user experience and increases process completion.  

As data analysts, our role is to:  
- Clean and merge the client, digital footprint, and experiment datasets  
- Analyze demographics and client behavior  
- Define metrics to measure success  
- Test hypotheses about the redesign’s impact  
- Provide data-driven recommendations  

👉 Our analysis will consider step-by-step completion rates, error rates (backward navigation), and average completion times, in addition to the overall confirmation rate.

## 🔬 Hypotheses  
1. **Completion Rate**  
   - The Test group will have a higher completion rate than the Control group.  
2. **Completion Rate with Threshold**  
   - The Test group will exceed the Control group’s completion rate by at least 5%.  
3. **Time on Steps**  
   - The Test group will spend less time on average at each process step.  
4. **Error Rate**  
   - The Test group will show fewer backward navigation errors.
